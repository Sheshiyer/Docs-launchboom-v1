About Josh

The mission at Josh.ai is to solve the user experience,
interoperability, and innovation challenges in the smart home.
Co-Founders Alex Capecelatro and Tim Gill encountered these
shortcomings first-hand when remodeling their own homes. At the
time, they did not know a lot about home automation technology.
After being pitched expensive, complicated, often outdated
interfaces, they felt like there had to be a better way. Founded in
2015, Josh is a Denver based company creating platforms and products
that enable true natural interaction with technology in everyday
life.


Since its founding, Josh has built a brand with mass-market appeal
while staying true to its roots. Through years of development
refining robust integrations, innovative features, and purposeful
design, the Josh platform has uniquely laid the groundwork for smart
homes going forward. This evolution has culminated in a modern
control solution, breaking all of the molds while ushering in a
multi-faceted home intelligence experience.


To guarantee each client enjoys a robust experience, Josh is
exclusively sold through certified technology integrators that meet
the company’s standards and have been properly trained. Every
project is unique and every home has its own demands, which requires
a professional touch to ensure each customer receives the
customization they deserve.


While Josh was initially developed to offer the perfect home
intelligence experience, the same potential exists in healthcare
facilities, hotels, commercial environments, and MDUs. Thanks to its
elegantly designed app interface, powerful natural language
processing engine, and contextual artificial intelligence, Josh is
transforming how we interact in our connected living spaces.


What is Josh?

With Josh, elegant design seamlessly blends with technology to
provide a simplified and secure control platform. Enjoy efficient
smart home accessibility with the Josh App or conveniently set the
mood with conversational voice commands. Josh knows its role and
continues to adapt, enabling users to freely interact with their
surroundings and automate their lifestyle in whatever way feels
easiest.


Simple

Josh is designed to empower every member of the family with
intuitive control and intelligent assistance. Through touch, text,
or natural voice commands, Josh provides unparalleled convenience.


Private

Josh understands that trust and responsibility help make a house a
home. All Josh products are engineered to continuously enhance
protecting user data and wellbeing.


Magical

Josh is always evolving and improving thanks to over-the-air
software updates. Every Josh user enjoys an immensely powerful yet
easy-to-use experience, offering unmatched accessibility and
personalization in the smart home.


Josh Milestones

In 2016, the first Josh
product shipped on a Mac Mini and was priced to be specified into
high-end luxury projects installed by select dealers.


In 2017, Josh launched Josh
Micro to combine a home control processor, far-field microphone
array, and revolutionary user interface all in a beautifully
designed package. As a WiFi and hardwired solution, Josh Micro
offered unparalleled installation flexibility and was the industry’s
first solution for location-aware voice control in every room.


At the end of 2020,
Josh introduced Josh Nano and Josh Core during its first ever
Keynote presentation. The world’s first Architectural Microphone,
Josh Nano is a beautiful device that seamlessly blends into any
design aesthetic. The Josh team worked closely with the
architecture, design, and professional installation communities to
rethink how voice control should perform in the world’s most
luxurious homes. Josh Core is the whole home processor, doubling
down on local processing to ensure that every client’s data is
private and secure.


In 2021,
Josh launched its collaboration with Lutron to introduce the Josh.ai
Ready Wallplate, which combines Lutron Keypads with Josh Nano
architectural microphones. The Josh.ai Ready Wallplate delivers
limitless control capabilities with voice, while maintaining tactile
control for the most used scenes, accessible at the touch of a
button through keypads. For example, clients can push a
pre-programmed “Relax” button on their keypad and also access the
nearly 16.7 million colors from Ketra, simply by saying what they
want.


In 2022, Josh Remote made its
debut to put the power of Josh in the palm of every client’s hand.
Josh Remote’s sleek handheld touch screen adds a complementary
interface to Josh systems that is complete with a dedicated “Speak
to Josh” microphone icon. Clients giving voice commands through Josh
Remote will experience the same contextual awareness that they enjoy
with their Josh microphones. While other remotes are dedicated to
cable, satellite, or streaming navigation, Josh Remote empowers
users to speak freely to their whole home.


In the summer of 2023, Josh
launched JoshGPT to become the first company to offer the
convenience of hands-free access to generative AI. A supercharged
assistant at home and on-the-go, customers can not only control
their connected devices, but also learn more about the things they
already love and discover new possibilities that they never imagined
with JoshGPT!


In the fall of 2023, Josh
launched the industry’s first AI powered home control platform with
Josh One. Josh One serves as a modern solution for customers that do
not need or desire voice control. Offering unmatched affordability
and sophistication, Josh One systems are built for efficient
deployments, optimal supportability, and freedom of choice for
user-friendly automation experiences.


Why Josh?

Today’s AI assistants and traditional control systems are not
meeting the data security standards or experiential goals for
partners looking to offer truly intelligent living. While DIY
products provide a novel entry point for smart home adopters,
professionally installed solutions quickly become antiquated and
cumbersome.


Focused on delivering exceptional user experiences, Josh offers
cutting edge hardware and software products making it easy to
install, service, and control connected environments. Josh
alleviates privacy concerns and customization challenges so that
every client can freely enjoy their smart home experience.


The Josh architecture is always evolving and improving through
over-the-air updates. By taking a software-focused approach, Josh
has uniquely positioned itself as a modern solution that
continuously offers compelling and contextual features. As the
industry enters a new era of Home Intelligence, Josh.ai is proudly
transforming the landscape of control with unparalleled efficiency,
innovation, and sophistication.


Who is Josh?

Co-founders Tim Gill and Alex Capecelatro make for an interesting,
yet optimal, team to tackle the smart home challenge. With a 34 year
age gap, they represent the boomers and the millennials. Gill
founded Quark in 1981 and pioneered a series of software solutions
through the 90’s. Quark expanded to over 160 countries generating
revenue in excess of $300MM per year as a private company. Tim is a
self-professed math geek and software savant. Capecelatro, on the
other hand, comes from a series of design-focused consumer products,
including Fisker’s enviable electric car, the Karma, and the iOS app
Yeti with members in more than 120 countries. Capecelatro has a
background in research science and a passion for bringing
cutting-edge technology to the masses.


Together Gill and Capecelatro represent the spread of the homeowner
market, have a unique ability to design, build, and release
exceptional products, and a track record of doing so.

#### Unleashing the limitless power and convenience of smart home automation

- Lighting Control




An environment is designed so that its beauty comes to life and alters depending on the mood of its beholders. Josh.ai’s control of Crestron lighting empowers homeowners to efficiently transform their space with natural voice commands and touch action control like never before.




![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/new3/device-icons/light-ctrl-icon-off.svg)

- “Ok Josh, turn off the lights in the kitchen."
- “Ok Josh, it’s too bright on the first floor."
- “Ok Josh, raise the lights in the foyer, dining room, and family room.”

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/brand-pages/crestron/lighting-control.jpg)

- Shade Control




The natural beauty of daylight evokes an emotional response. Colors read true, finishes reveal their texture, and an uplifting quality pervades any room bathed in its natural ambiance. Josh.ai’s control of Crestron shading systems provides effortless and precise control of daylight.





![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/new3/device-icons/shades-icon.svg)

- “Ok Josh, raise the shades 30%"
- “Ok Josh, close the blackouts at 10pm"
- "Ok Josh, bring up the blinds a little bit"

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/brand-pages/crestron/shade-control.jpg)

- Temperature Control




Heating and cooling accounts for nearly half of a home’s energy consumption. Josh.ai's control of Crestron thermostats, as well as proactive recommendations geared towards resource management, help homeowners live more efficiently.





![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/new3/device-icons/thermostats-icon.svg)

- "OK Josh, turn the living room thermostat to 70 degrees."
- "OK Josh, I’m warm."
- “OK Josh, it’s too chilly on the first floor.”

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/brand-pages/crestron/climate-control-with-micro.jpg)

- Audio/Video Control



**Crestron Home AV**




In order to support Crestron Home AV distribution, Josh.ai will require a second authorization token that is set by the integrator. This additional token is the same one that is currently used for Crestron Home touchpads and remotes. Once both tokens are authorized, Josh.ai will begin auto-populating all compatible devices that have already been programmed within Crestron Home’s interface. For AV distribution, Josh.ai will map the floor plan of the project with all known media zones and their corresponding content sources.




**Crestron SIMPL AV**




Once the SIMPL AV Room and Source modules have been programmed, Josh.ai will automatically know what AV sources are accessible in each area of the home. This hardware agnostic approach allows Josh.ai to seamlessly support any system design no matter the complexity or components. As long as Crestron is the routing backbone, Josh.ai will be able to communicate from endpoint to endpoint. The interface has been designed with dealer feedback and guidance, allowing installers to set up complicated distributed AV workflows accurately and efficiently, without re-doing their original programming.







The end result enables the user experience of walking into a theater, and asking, “OK Josh, watch Mad Men.” Josh.ai understands the request is coming from the theater, utilizes a knowledge graph to find Mad Men on Netflix, determines which AV source can provide that content, informs Crestron to route that source, activate the video environment, and -- like magic -- Mad Men starts playing!

Frequently Asked Questions

Josh Certified Dealers,
[login](https://help.josh.ai/)
for additional resources.


Can i change josh's name?

While the default wake phrase for activating Josh’s
microphones is "Ok Josh," it can be updated at any time.
[Josh Micro](https://www.josh.ai/micro/)
offers "Ok Home" and "Hey Micro" as options, while
[Josh Nano](https://www.josh.ai/nano/)
systems provide “Nikola” as a single-word alternative. We
encourage you to choose whichever option feels most natural.
In addition to changing the wake phrase, you may also name
your system to add a personal touch. For example, clients with
multiple properties can uniquely name each one to help them
identify a home within the
[Josh App](https://www.josh.ai/josh-app/). Along with changing a property’s name, users also have the
power to adjust the gender and accent of their Josh system’s
voice to customize the persona they’re speaking to.


Will josh work with my phone?


Josh works with most Android and iOS phones and tablets. You
can also control Josh from any computer using our web
dashboard. Whether you’re an iPhone 7s or Galaxy S7 person,
Josh will work for you.


Does josh do more beyond smart home control?


In addition to providing a best-in-class home intelligence
platform, Josh is a fully capable assistant that can set
alarms/timers, calculate math equations, define and spell
words, and more!
[JoshGPT](https://www.josh.ai/joshgpt/)
takes intelligent assistance a step further by leveraging the
full potential of generative AI. Clients are able to have
conversational interactions with
[JoshGPT](https://www.josh.ai/joshgpt/)
so that their questions are not only answered, but they also
receive insightful clarifications and conversational feedback.
Whether a user is looking for nearby restaurant
recommendations, curious about the inspiration behind their
favorite songs, or wants help planning the logistics of their
upcoming vacation,
[JoshGPT](https://www.josh.ai/joshgpt/)
generates tailored and engaging responses.


Does enabling joshgpt jeopardize my data or privacy?


[JoshGPT](https://www.josh.ai/joshgpt/)
doesn’t jeopardize any of your data or privacy. It’s an option
that you can enable and disable at any time to access
generative intelligence. If
[JoshGPT](https://www.josh.ai/joshgpt/)
is disabled, Josh will continue working as a smart home
control platform with its included assistant features.


Can i talk to josh when away from home?


Absolutely! One of the most convenient aspects of Josh is the
ability to use it from anywhere in the world right from your
smartphone. Remotely speak to your home and access
[JoshGPT's limitless intelligence](https://www.josh.ai/joshgpt/)
on-the-go via the voice button in the Josh App.


Does josh have an api?

While Josh is customizable in a number of ways, we don’t offer
an open API for 3rd party development yet. If you’re
interested in exploring integration and partnership
opportunities, please
[reach out](mailto:partners@josh.ai)

Is there a limit to the number of devices I can connect to
Josh?

solutions are built to scale to accommodate however many
connected devices are in your home. Feel free to reach out

our team continually optimizes the system based on the
diction, syntax, and accents from a variety of English
speakers. If you find that Josh is having trouble
understanding you, please
[let us know](mailto:sales@josh.ai).


What if josh stops working?


If you’re having challenges accessing the
[Josh App](https://www.josh.ai/josh-app/), speaking to a Josh microphone, or something isn’t working
properly, don’t fear. Josh never interferes with your ability
to control your devices directly. You can always operate each
individual device with their switches, buttons, app, etc. Josh
will never override your ability to have control of your home
and peace of mind.


Does josh work in environments other than the smart home?


Absolutely! Our primary market is residential, but any
connected environment can be equipped with Josh. Our team is
actively exploring opportunities across the commercial,
hospitality, healthcare, education, transportation, and
mobility verticals. If you have a unique use-case, feel free

Who can i contact if i have questions?


If you have questions about Josh’s integrations, pricing, open
positions, or general smart home inquiries, please
[reach out](mailto:contact@josh.ai) and a member of
our team will be in touch!


What is Josh?

[Josh.ai](https://www.josh.ai/)
launched in 2015 as an advanced AI for the custom home and has
grown into a complete control solution. Through years of
development refining robust integrations, innovative features,
and purposeful design, the Josh.ai platform has uniquely laid
the groundwork for smart homes going forward. This evolution has
culminated in a modern control system that’s ushering in the
next era of multi-faceted and intuitive user experiences.


What can users do with the Josh App?


A robust platform for personalization, the
[Josh App](https://www.josh.ai/josh-app/)
provides seamless control over everything an intelligent home
has to offer. Clients enjoy an elegant layout that includes
quick access to their system’s settings, custom dashboards,
devices, areas, and scenes. In addition to configuring a scene
with device-specific adjustments, Josh.ai’s Natural Language
Scene Editor empowers all users to simply type or voice dictate
a scene’s activations and conditional automations.


How does josh protect my data and privacy?


We take every measure to ensure Josh is safe and secure. We
encrypt all messages, use industry-standard protocols, and are
always optimizing our processes to ensure our clients are
protected. Learn more on our
[Privacy Page.](https://www.josh.ai/privacy/)

How can i buy josh?

Currently, Josh is exclusively available through our network of
certified home technology providers. Josh requires a
professional installer to ensure that the entirety of your smart
home is set up and supported properly. To connect with a local
Josh dealer, please reach out through our
[Get Josh](https://www.josh.ai/get-josh/)
page.


How much does josh cost?

The cost of a Josh system depends on the scale of your home and
the experience you’d like to have. Feel free to reach out
through our
[Get Josh](https://www.josh.ai/get-josh/)
page for a one-on-one consultation with a member of our team.


Where is josh available?

The Josh team is currently focused on building our presence in
the United States and Canada. Join our mailing list to stay up
to date for when Josh expands internationally!


Why is your logo a dog?

Much like a dog, Josh is intelligent, responsive, and learns its
owner’s commands. Unlike other home control systems that you
can’t take on-the-go, or only know one trick, Josh combines all
aspects of a smart home AI into a well-trained companion. Josh
is a home’s best friend, and always happy to interact with you.


Why is your ai called Josh?

Since Josh is an artificial intelligence you can speak with, we
thought it fitting to give it a name that was both friendly and
familiar. When you search “Josh” in Google, the first result is
from Urban Dictionary which states, “He is a fun loving guy
really funny and can make anyone laugh. He is very quiet at
first and seems shy but when you get to know him you will fall
in love.” With that we thought Josh was a pretty good choice!


Does josh learn?

Josh is constantly improving and evolving via over-the-air
software updates. If you enable Josh’s AI Learning feature, it
will also begin recommending actions as you use it more based on
your living patterns.


If i move, can i take josh with me?


Absolutely! While some clients have sold their homes with Josh
as part of the deal, you can easily transfer your system to a
new address with the help of your home technology professional.


Does josh work when the internet goes down?


While the majority of processing and control is done locally,
Josh requires access to the cloud. If the internet is down, Josh
will lose that access and cannot be used until the internet is
restored. Note that if your internet is down, you will also not
be able to use other network enabled services, such as streaming
music through Sonos and watching video content through Roku.


What products does josh support / will josh work with my
existing devices?


To date, Josh has focused on integrating with professional
solutions and a variety of popular smart home products like
[Lutron](https://www.josh.ai/lutron/),
[Sonos](https://www.josh.ai/sonos/),
[Roku](https://www.josh.ai/roku/),
and
[Sony](https://www.josh.ai/sony/).
Josh is always adding more devices to its ecosystem so visit our
[Works With](https://www.josh.ai/devices)
page to see all of Josh’s integrations. Feel free to
[contact us](mailto:partners@josh.ai)
with specific inquiries as well.

RVC Systems

"My experience with Josh.ai has been fantastic, from
installing/programming to tech support. I was able to install
the unit in the client's home, program it, test and have it all
working in less than 30 minutes. I've never installed a system
so easily."


Chad, Mosaic Systems

“I haven’t been this excited about a technology since I started
over 20 years ago. It’s crazy how quickly you guys are moving.”


Hometech.FM

"I was kind of shocked as to how much they have done. It's been
marketed as being a voice control system, but it's so much more
than that!"


Josh: The Mission

Josh is purpose-built to solve the complexities that luxury
homes present to system integrators. Installation is simple,
intuitive, and efficient with an array of diagnostic tools for

What is the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction?


![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/marketing/avatar_josh.png)

“As of June 2023, the most expensive artwork ever sold at
auction is a painting by Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani
titled "Nu Couché (Sur Le Côté Gauche)" (1917-1918).​​
This piece was sold at Christie's in New York in 2018 for
a staggering $157.2 million, setting a new record for the
highest price ever paid for a work of art at auction.​ "Nu
Couché" depicts a reclining nude woman on a blue divan,
and is considered one of Modigliani's most iconic works.​
The painting's high price can be attributed to both its
rarity and its historical significance, as well as to the
reputation and influence of Modigliani himself, who is
widely considered to be one of the most important artists
of the 20th century.”

The pigments used for the painting include natural earth
pigments, as well as pigments made from organic substances
such as plants and insects.​ These pigments were mixed
with a variety of oils, such as linseed oil, walnut oil,
or poppyseed oil, to create the desired colors and
textures.​ The oil painting technique was popularized in
the Renaissance period and remains a commonly used medium
for painting to this day.​ The Mona Lisa is considered one
of the greatest masterpieces of Western art and is
renowned for its technical and artistic achievements.”

What is the best way to mince garlic?


![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/marketing/avatar_josh.png)

“One of the best ways to mince garlic is to first peel the
cloves and then finely chop them with a sharp knife on a
cutting board.​​ Begin by crushing the garlic clove with
the flat side of the chef's knife, and then remove the
skin.​ Then, slice the garlic as thinly as possible and
then chop the slices into tiny pieces.​ Alternatively, you
can use a garlic press to crush garlic cloves and mince
them directly into your dish.​ It is recommended to use
freshly minced garlic for the best flavor and aroma.”

"Certainly, I can give you two dinner recipes from
Korea!

rice, sautéed vegetables, beef, and a fried egg. The dish
is then mixed before eating and served with gochujang, a
spicy red pepper paste that gives it a delicious kick.


2) Japchae: This is a dish that consists of stir-fried
glass noodles with vegetables and either beef, chicken or
pork. It has a slightly sweet flavor due to the use of soy
sauce and sesame oil and is often served as a side dish to
accompany rice.​"

Where is the world's tallest tree and how tall is it?


![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/marketing/avatar_josh.png)

“As of 2021, the world's tallest tree known to science is
named Hyperion, a coast redwood tree (Sequoia
sempervirens) in California, USA.​​ It was discovered in
2006, and measures 379.7 feet tall. Hyperion is located in
Redwood National Park and is one of many massive trees in
the old-growth forest that blankets much of the Pacific
Northwest.​ The exact location of Hyperion is kept a
secret to protect the tree and preserve its natural
environment.​ However, visitors to the park can experience
the awe-inspiring beauty and majesty of these giant
redwood trees, which can live for thousands of years and
grow to be hundreds of feet tall.​ The coast redwood trees
are some of the oldest and tallest living organisms on the
planet and are truly a spectacular sight to behold."

When was the last Ice Age?

"The last Ice Age, also known as the Pleistocene epoch,
began around 2.6 million years ago and ended approximately
11,700 years ago.​​ This period was characterized by
massive ice sheets and glaciers that covered much of the
Earth's surface, including parts of North America, Europe,
and Asia.​ The Ice Age had a significant impact on the
planet's geography, ecosystem, and climate, shaping the
landforms and habitats that are still present today.​ The
end of the Ice Age marked the beginning of the Holocene
epoch, which is the current geological epoch and has been
characterized by relatively stable climate conditions that
have enabled human civilization to flourish."

emergency vehicles before moving to residential areas.​
Denver uses a combination of plow trucks, front-end
loaders, and deicers to remove snow and ice from the
streets and to prevent slippery conditions.​"

Would you recommend walking from Brentwood to the beach?


![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/marketing/avatar_josh.png)

“You could potentially walk to the beach from Brentwood,
but it would still be a very long walk and could take
several hours depending on which beach you choose to
visit.​ Additionally, parts of the route may be uphill or
on busy roads with limited pedestrian facilities.​ A more
convenient and efficient way to get to the beach from
Brentwood would be to use alternative modes of
transportation such as biking or taking a bus or
ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft.​ Beverly Hills
and Santa Monica are two popular nearby cities that
provide a variety of public transportation options to the
beach.​”

home's premium sound system.

The Story Behind the Logo

Josh is a home’s best friend. And like a dog, Josh is intelligent,
responsive, and learns his owner’s commands. While other smart home
control systems only know one trick, Josh combines all aspects of
smart homes into one friendly, well-trained responder. Josh is your
companion, and always happy to see you come home.

1   What information do we collect and for what purpose


The categories of information we collect can include:


- **Information you provide to us directly.** We may
collect personal information, such as your name, phone number,

We collect information about how you use the Service and how you
use other products and services through the Service, your
actions on the Service, and content you provide or post to the
Service, including the groups you belong to, your interaction
with the service and with your friends and with others on the
Service, and photos and videos you post to the Service, and any
content you provide through any functionality of the Service
(“User Content”). To share photos and video, we will access your

Please remember that the Company may, but has no obligation to,
monitor, record, and store User Content in order to protect your
safety or the safety of other users, to assist with regulatory
or law enforcement efforts, or to protect and defend our rights
and property. By using the Service, you consent to the
recording, storage and disclosure of such communications you
send or receive for all of the foregoing purposes.

- **Information we collect from social networks.**
When you interact with our Service through various social media,
such as when you login through Facebook or when you follow
Company or share Company content on Facebook, Twitter,
Pinterest, Instagram or other sites, we may receive information
from those social networks including your profile information,
picture, user ID associated with your social media account,
friends list, and any other information you permit the social
network to share with third parties. We may use information
about your connections on social media to let you know what your
friends are doing on our Service, and to let your friends know
what you are doing on the Service, and we may use it to suggest
new friends you may want to connect with. The data we receive is
dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network.
You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy
settings on third-party websites and services before linking or
connecting them to our website or Service.

- **Address Book Information.** With your permission,
Company may access your contact list available on your mobile

Service and invite your friends and contacts to connect with our
Service. When we send the invitation to you to join the Service,
we will include your name and photo to let them know that you
are the person extending the invitation. After sending these
invitations, we may also send reminder emails to your invitees
on your behalf, which may also include your name and photo. We
will store these contacts for purposes of alerting you when your
contacts join Company at a later time so that you may connect
with them on the Service, and to suggest friends and connections
to other members of Company. Company may also use the
information collected from your contact list and your friends'

or improve the Service and then delete location data tied to
your personal information. We may maintain de-identified
location data for a longer period of time in order to analyze
aggregate trends and metrics. If you want to opt-out of the
collection of your location data, please adjust your settings in
your mobile device to limit the app’s access to your location
data. Please see “Control Over Your Information” below to learn
more.

Amazon Echo or Google Home), third parties’ services and
products used through the Service, and third party contractors
and service providers, such as architects, designers, builders,
and integrators. We may also collect information about you that
is publicly available.




We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you
the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to
communicate directly with you, such as to send you email
messages and push notifications, and permit you to communicate
with others on the Service or on social media or invite others
to join the Service. We may also send you Service-related emails
or messages (e.g., account verification, change or updates to
features of the Service, technical and security notices). For
more information about your communication preferences, see
“Control Over Your Information” below.


2   How we use cookies and other tracking technology to collect
information


We, and our third party partners, automatically collect certain
types of usage information when you visit our Services, read our
emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this
information through a variety of tracking technologies, including
cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, file information and similar
technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”). For example, we
collect information about your device and its software, such as your
IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type,
device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that
allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your
account, and other such information. We also collect information
about the way you use our Services, for example, the site from which
you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our
website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently
you access the Services, whether you open emails or click the links
contained in emails, whether you access the Services from multiple
devices, and other actions you take on the Services. When you access
our Services from a mobile device, we may collect unique
identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile
application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for
Advertisers (“IDFA”), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID),
mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device
operating system brand and model, phone number, and depending on
your mobile device settings, your geographical location data,
including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or
similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or
we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other
information, like an IP address. We may collect analytics data, or
use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and
usage trends for the Services and to understand more about the
demographics of our users. We may also work with third party
partners to employ technologies, including the application of
statistical modeling tools, which attempt to recognize you across
multiple devices. Although we do our best to honor the privacy
preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track
signals set by your browser at this time.


We use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies
to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter
it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b)
provide custom, personalized content and information, including
targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple
devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service;
(e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors,
traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (f)
diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for
and enhance our service.


If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow
you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you
receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it;
(ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to
automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may
negatively impact your experience using the Services, as some
features and services on our Services may not work properly.
Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be
able to delete or block all cookies. You may also set your e-mail
options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may
contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have
accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it.
\[Deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such\
as Flash objects and HTML5. You can learn more about Flash objects -\
including how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash\
cookies – on Adobe’s website or by clicking here. If you choose to\
delete Flash objects from our sites, then you may not be able to\
access and use all or part of the sites or benefit from the\
information and services offered.\]


We and our third party partners may also use cookies and tracking
technologies for advertising purposes. For more information about
tracking technologies, please see “Third Party Tracking and Online
Advertising” below.

We may share your personal information in the instances described
below. For further information on your choices regarding your

We may share your personal information with:


- Others who you allow to use or who have access to the Service
may have access to data regarding your use of the Service, as

individuals. You may be able to control the visibility of some
of your information and actions in your Settings (see "Control

- Third parties at your request. For example, you may have the
option to share your activities on the Services with your

as Company, and any organization that owns or controls us. These
companies will use your personal information in the same way as

- Third-party vendors and other service providers that perform
services on our behalf, as needed to carry out their work for
us, which may include identifying and serving targeted

contests, providing web hosting services, or providing analytic
services (as well as improving their services and our Service);

pages;

- Other parties in connection with a company transaction, such as
a merger, sale of company assets or shares, reorganization,
financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion
of our business by another company or third party, or in the
event of a bankruptcy or related or similar proceedings; and

- Third parties as required by law or subpoena or if we reasonably
believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law
and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce
our
[Terms of Use](https://www.josh.ai/terms)
or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or
(c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal
safety of Company, our visitors, or others.

**Profile and Data Sharing Settings.** You may update
your profile information, such as your user name and profile photo,

settings page or by emailing us at
[privacy@josh.ai](mailto:privacy@josh.ai).

any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting your
information, or if you want to remove your name or comments from our
website or publicly displayed content, you can contact us directly
at
[privacy@josh.ai](mailto:privacy@josh.ai). We may not be able to modify or delete your information in all
circumstances.


5   Third party tracking and online advertising


We may share, or we may permit third party online advertising
networks, social media companies and other third party services, to
collect, information about your use of our website over time so that
they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests
on our Service as well as on other websites or apps, or on other
devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information
we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking
technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect
information, including hashed data, click stream information,
browser type, time and date you visited the site, and other
information. This information is used to display targeted ads on or
through our Service or on other websites or apps, including on
Facebook. We or the online advertising networks use this information
to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your
interests. As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile
device, you may be able set your browser to delete or notify you of
cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the
settings on your browser or mobile device. You may also be able to
limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile
device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of
interest based ads” (Android). To learn more about interest-based
advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this
advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising
Initiative’s online resources, at
[http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices), and/or the DAA’s resources at
[www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), and you may also adjust your ad preferences through your Facebook
settings. You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all –
interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting
[http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices)
and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. If you have any questions
about opting out of the collection of cookies and other
tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at
[privacy@josh.ai](mailto:privacy@josh.ai).


Facebook Custom Audience Ads. We may work with Facebook to display
interest-based ads to you or to your friends on Facebook through a
tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool. This tool
allows us to personalize our ads based on you or your friends’
experience on our Service in order to provide ads tailored for each
specific recipient. We do not share personal information about your
activities on our Service with Facebook, but we share a hashed email
address or phone number which permits Facebook to identify our
advertising audience based on the information that Facebook collects
from its users. If you do not want to receive interest-based ads on
Facebook, you can adjust your ad preferences through your Facebook
settings. If you do not want us to use your content to personalize
advertising that we direct to your friends on Facebook, you may
email us at
[privacy@josh.ai](mailto:privacy@josh.ai).

Built for Privacy

At Josh, we believe that trust and responsibility help make a house a home. We understand the importance of protecting personal data, and we engineer our products to continuously enhance those protections.

Voice You Can Trust

Josh will never use client information for marketing purposes or sell user data to third parties. Unlike the mass-market voice assistants, Josh's sole focus is on providing the best smart home experience possible.


A critical component of being a premium home OS is that the actions and words spoken behind closed doors stay there. We not only protect the privacy of our clients and their families, but continuously optimize how Josh secures the data it collects.


![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/other-icons-mic-active-icon@3x.png)

MICROPHONE PRIVACY

Josh is always ready to help, but only listens when it is woken up. Simply address and activate your Josh microphone with its wake word when you want to make a request. By default, the wake word to activate a Josh Micro and Josh Nano is “Ok Josh.” The wake word can also be changed to “Ok Home” or “Hey Micro.”

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/device-ctrl-lock-ctrl-lock-ctrl-unlocked-icon@3x.png)

SECURE & TRANSPARENT ACCESS

Every property has different needs, and Josh provides clients with complete control over the access that each resident and guest has to their home's technology. All Josh clients are guided through an account set-up flow that enforces strict password requirements and user roles. Authentication is required by users when logging into the Josh App through their mobile phones and tablets.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/other-icons-magic-wand-icon@3x.png)

ALWAYS IMPROVING

When AI Learning is enabled, Josh is always improving based on how clients are interacting with their smart homes. If AI learning is disabled, Josh will not be able to optimize a client’s experience based on his or her usage patterns or behaviors.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/device-icon-access-control-icon@3x.png)

PROACTIVE PRIVACY SETTINGS

At Josh, we believe that our clients and their Home Technology Professionals should have complete control over their smart home’s privacy settings. Josh’s settings enable users to permanently delete their system’s Chat History at any point. However, erasing command transcripts may limit both Josh’s ability to learn as well as a Home Technology Professional’s ability to troubleshoot challenges in the event that support is necessary.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/other-icons-unknown-icon@3x.png)

WAKE WORD DETECTION

Every Josh interface is tuned and continually refined so that it hears voice commands as accurately as possible. Naturally, voice technology presents a balancing act to offer optimal performance while minimizing false activations. Since phrases similar to the wake word can accidentally trigger Josh to start listening, it's a good idea for each client to explore the alternate options that work well in their household.

Josh Core runs most processing locally, including natural language programming, logs, device discovery & more.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/josh-core-front-angled-LED.png)

Josh prioritizes local processing whenever possible. When local processing is not an option, one of the following cloud services will be accessed through an encrypted connection.

System Availability

In the event that Josh falls offline due to a power or network outage, a cloud backup is available to quickly bring the system back online.

Speech Recognition

After Josh is woken up (by saying “Ok Josh”), it starts processing audio through encrypted cloud services. Once the audio is converted to text, Josh processes the command locally to complete the client’s request.

Expanded Services

When Josh is fulfilling a request for music, video, weather, news, etc., it leverages web service partners to access the most up-to-date entertainment and searchable information.

Cloud Devices

In limited cases, Josh controls third-party devices through an authenticated cloud connection.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/ig-all-black-muted@2x.png)

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/oval@3x.png)

LED Feedback

Users will always be able to tell when Josh’s listening because the LED dial on Josh Micro and Josh Nano will animate in a spinning rainbow animation. A pulsating rainbow animation means that Josh has finished listening to your request and is processing your command.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/other-icons-mic-muted-icon@3x.png)

Muting Josh

For additional security, you can ensure that a Josh microphone does not accidentally activate by muting its microphones. By default, a single-tap of the capacitive touch dial of Josh Micro and Josh Nano performs a mute. Another single tap reactivates the microphones. When muted, Josh’s LED dial will display a red-orange light to signal the microphone is disabled.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/other-icons-hide-password-icon@3x.png)

PRIVACY BUILT-IN

Simply slide the privacy switch down and the microphones in Josh Nano are physically disconnected, providing peace of mind that nobody can be listening in.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/privacy/other-icons-floor-icon@3x.png)

ENTERPRISE GRADE ARCHITECTURE

Josh’s cloud is built on a secure, enterprise-grade platform that regularly performs audits and maintains PCI, HIPAA, ISO, and SOC compliance.

## Josh Core

### Step 1

### Step 1

Connect one end of the cable into a PoE capable port of your network switch, and connect the other end into the network port of the Josh Core.

Make sure the cable clicks into position at both ends.

When Josh Core receives power via the network cable, you will see the LEDs light up white. A few seconds later they will change to blue, signifying that Josh Core is ready for set up.

If the unit doesn’t power on, make sure the network cable is connected to a PoE port on your network switch, and that the network switch is powered on.

[Josh Core](https://www.josh.ai/setup/core) [Josh One (Legacy)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/one-legacy) [Josh One](https://www.josh.ai/setup/one) [Josh Micro (POE)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/micro-poe) [Josh Micro (WIFI)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/micro-wifi) [Josh Nano](https://www.josh.ai/setup/nano) [Josh Remotes](https://www.josh.ai/setup/remote) [Josh Touchscreen](https://www.josh.ai/setup/touchscreen)

[support@josh.ai](mailto:support@josh.ai)

## Josh Micro (POE)

### Step 1

### Step 1

Pick a Location

Start by choosing where you’d like to wall-mount your Micro. You’ll need an ethernet cable equipped with POE running through your wall—Any Cat5, Cat5e, or Cat6 cable should work. [Contact us](mailto:support@josh.ai) if you have questions.

A great place to mount Josh Micro is on the wall near the entrance to room at conversation height, approximately 5 - 5.5ft. You will find that Micros fit well in similar locations as thermostats and light switches.

![](https://www.josh.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fexzalvt1%2Fproduction%2F2a338d767610877e87c22050a7cd4b5f86f4eee7-340x340.jpg%3Fw%3D1000%26q%3D75%26auto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)

### Step 2

### Step 2

Mark the Spot

Hold the black wall mount ring (included) up to the wall you’ve chosen to mount Micro to. Mark the inner circle and the three screw locations in pencil.

Don’t worry if the base screw holes aren’t lined up perfectly. Josh Micro magnetically attaches to the base and can be straightened at any point.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/ec2d2c05e0a026b12d67138a6c851d32edc6138e-340x340.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 3

### Step 3

Drill the Holes

Drill holes for the wall screws and a center hole for the POE cable.

Again, don’t worry if the base screw holes aren’t lined up perfectly. Josh Micro magnetically attaches to the base and can be straightened at any point.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/c7f9f353228fb4739dd0d63a7417a0b3517dd1d7-340x340.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 4

### Step 4

Mount the Ring

Install the wall mount ring to the wall using the provided screws. Make sure the ring is snug, but no need to overtighten.

If you misplace the screws, let us know and we can help you get replacements.

In some cases you’ll want to get drywall anchors as well to help the screws hold.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/9df98edbf0fffb360b3b663a3237c2e89e5c2dfd-340x340.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 5

### Step 5

Plug in Micro

Connect the POE adapter (provided) to your POE cable, then plug the USB-C end of the adapter into the bottom of Josh Micro.

When Micro is ready to set up you'll see the LEDs light up blue.

If the unit doesn’t power on, make sure the POE cable is delivering both power as well as network connectivity.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/5c9ed5c2c8402f862282a6f9775f3015e9e5679b-340x340.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 6

### Step 6

Wall Mount Micro

Bring the Micro to the wall mount ring while feeding the POE cable through the wall. It should should fit snug to the wall mount.

Finally, rotate Josh Micro making sure the dog logo is properly oriented and level.

[Josh Core](https://www.josh.ai/setup/core) [Josh One (Legacy)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/one-legacy) [Josh One](https://www.josh.ai/setup/one) [Josh Micro (POE)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/micro-poe) [Josh Micro (WIFI)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/micro-wifi) [Josh Nano](https://www.josh.ai/setup/nano) [Josh Remotes](https://www.josh.ai/setup/remote) [Josh Touchscreen](https://www.josh.ai/setup/touchscreen)

[support@josh.ai](mailto:support@josh.ai)

## Josh Nano

### Step 1

### Step 1

Make sure Josh Core is set up and powered on.

In order to set up Josh Nano, you need to have a Josh Core on your network, and an Ethernet (Cat5, Cat5e, or Cat6) cable running to the install location.

![](https://www.josh.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fexzalvt1%2Fproduction%2F584d1473275d2a23ca5ee356d68a9dc312448b56-500x500.jpg%3Fw%3D1000%26q%3D75%26auto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)

### Step 2

### Step 2

Drill a 1 1/4” hole\* through the wall at the install location, and run ethernet cable to the hole.

**\*NOTE**: While a 1 1/4" diameter hole for Josh Nano is recommended, if you are going to be pulling wire through the hole or doing other work, the hole may get damaged and expand in size. If you anticipate this issue, please consider selecting a smaller drill bit and expand as needed.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/1c369fed0ca3f694db1a218823b9c70e1995012c-520x520.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 3

### Step 3

Before you power up Josh Nano, you need to connect it to the Josh Link. Simply push the two pieces together until you hear a click.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/ec685d3908b786caf5ed0af4489c725e7ce7bd90-520x520.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 4

### Step 4

Connect the PoE adapter to the back of Josh Link.

You should hear and feel the adapter click when it is connected correctly.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/c81c3068d7acdbca3af452b3d9073d5adc321913-520x520.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 5

### Step 5

Simply slide the wall clip over the Josh Link and secure it with the provided screws.

This will help secure the PoE adapter to the Josh Link to avoid any possibility of it becoming unplugged during the install.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/78676c2d01a71aece58cf1923fc9b9b52cdf6d87-520x520.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 6

### Step 6

Connect the ethernet cable to the PoE adapter.

We recommend using high quality RJ-45 connectors that will snap into place and not pull out easily.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/7c2afba9617b34261de438f68e9fc097db37dd7e-520x520.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 7

### Step 7

Install Josh Nano into the wall.

Insert the entire unit into the install hole, starting with the PoE adapter and ending with the Josh Nano. Make sure it is pressed firmly into the wall to ensure the wall clip engages.

Make sure Josh Nano is as level as possible as you insert the device into the wall, so that you do not have to adjust it while it's in the wall.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/02fd3f031450c0225ccdfdb9e808b5dead38b095-520x520.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 8

### Step 8

[support@josh.ai](mailto:support@josh.ai)

## Josh Remotes

### Step 1

### Step 1

Before Powering On.

Josh Remotes run on an Android operating system and require a Google Play store account to activate. Installers should create a unique account for each client's home that is specific to their Josh.ai system.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/f6011b6eeda0bd1894fc9bfea1fde6fd8b103855-500x500.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 2

### Step 2

Complete Setup Wizard.

The setup wizard requires installers to complete three steps:

1. Connect Josh Remote to the same WiFi network as the rest of the Josh.ai system.
2. Select the client's timezone.
3. Log into the Google Play store with the client's unique account information from step one.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/a1b595393b6c1fd67e82ae9312e2935f48cb3d11-300x500.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 3

### Step 3

Josh Account Login.

Next you will be asked to login to the client’s Josh account.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/f9dea4a42e200f49d0cccbd70160c8b3d1d15c26-300x500.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 4

### Step 4

Room Assignment.

After making sure Josh Remote has been properly added to the client's Josh.ai system, navigate to device settings and assign it to a room.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/27899fd71a8cade9d171259ca3fc0ece4318cce4-300x500.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 5

### Step 5

Allow Audio Access.

By allowing audio access, "While Using The App," clients will enjoy contextual voice control via Josh Remote over their entire smart home. Microphone access can be disabled at any time if a client prefers to use the elegantly designed remote interface strictly for handheld control.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/936f306dc90e31a9509382620426213bae8474c3-300x500.gif?w=1000&q=75&auto=format)

### Step 6

### Step 6

Success!

Josh Remote is ready for TV control, scene activation, and voice commands in a client's living spaces!

[Josh Core](https://www.josh.ai/setup/core) [Josh One (Legacy)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/one-legacy) [Josh One](https://www.josh.ai/setup/one) [Josh Micro (POE)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/micro-poe) [Josh Micro (WIFI)](https://www.josh.ai/setup/micro-wifi) [Josh Nano](https://www.josh.ai/setup/nano) [Josh Remotes](https://www.josh.ai/setup/remote) [Josh Touchscreen](https://www.josh.ai/setup/touchscreen)

[support@josh.ai](mailto:support@josh.ai)

## Josh Touchscreen

### Step 1

### Step 1

Remove mounting plate from touchscreen.

Loosen the two screws on the sides until the mounting plate can pull away from the back of the Touchscreen. Keep the screws threaded just enough to pull off the plate without fully removing them from the Touchscreen. We suggest using the Phillips PH#0 screwdriver for installation.

![](https://www.josh.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fexzalvt1%2Fproduction%2F63816674682037c9bc17ed266623eda8d1555625-4032x3024.jpg%3Fw%3D1000%26q%3D75%26auto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)

### Step 2

### Step 2

Attach mounting plate to single-gang box.

Use the supplied screws to fix the metal mounting plate to the single gang box. The plate must be mounted horizontally.

![](https://www.josh.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fexzalvt1%2Fproduction%2Ff5fe7a0ad6cb88e69d91567adfb7ee0f5f4c947c-3980x2985.jpg%3Fw%3D1000%26q%3D75%26auto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)

### Step 3

### Step 3

Plug POE cable into the back of the touchscreen.

Thread the POE cable through the center of the mounting plate and plug it in to the back of the Touchscreen.

![](https://www.josh.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fexzalvt1%2Fproduction%2F648478a9ee7fd17e95e377c9dbf402aa0c6f47e8-5712x4284.jpg%3Fw%3D1000%26q%3D75%26auto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)

### Step 4

### Step 4

Secure touchscreen to the mounting plate.

Slide the Touchscreen onto the mounting plate, making sure that the screw fixtures fit into the recesses in the back of the device. The back of the Touchscreen should be flush with the plate. Then tighten the screws until the touchscreen is secure.

![](https://www.josh.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fexzalvt1%2Fproduction%2Ff9bbfb7abc1dd4c52e77f4fcd96fbbf750fc4d4c-4403x3302.jpg%3Fw%3D1000%26q%3D75%26auto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)

### Step 5

### Step 5

Complete setup.

Remove the screen cover and complete the guided setup instructions. If not connected to POE then follow the wifi setup wizard to connect to internet.

#### Tuning the smart home experience to the right beat.

[![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/brand-pages/sonos/sonos_logo.png)](https://sonos.com/)

Sonos was founded in 2002 with a simple vision - help music lovers play any song anywhere in their homes. That mission inspired the invention of the multi-room wireless home audio system and significant innovation around intuitive user design. This focus on the user experience included a quick and easy setup process, integration with any technology or streaming service, and delivering superior sound quality regardless of the environment. Today, Sonos continues perfecting its product range with the mission of inspiring the world to listen better.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/brand-pages/sonos/partner-image-1.jpg)

### About the Partnership

Josh.ai and Sonos share the goal of intuitively simplifying home technology. The integration offers music lovers the flexibility to play their favorite songs, artists, albums, or genres using Josh.ai’s natural voice control and elegantly designed app. As each company innovates, additional features like grouping audio zones, ducking volume, and broadcasting Josh Micro's response through VoiceCast will continue enriching the user experience.

### Unlimited Control

Josh.ai controls Sonos’ range of products using proprietary Natural Language Processing. Simply speak to Josh Micro as if you have a personal DJ in your home.

![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/new3/device-icons/sound-systems-icon.svg)

“OK Josh, listen to Rolling in the Deep by Adele.”

![](https://d35408cyocioye.cloudfront.net/new3/device-icons/sound-systems-icon.svg)

"OK Josh, play Mozart in the Kitchen, Dining Room, and Library.”

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/brand-pages/sonos/control-image.png)

### Simple to Setup

Once Josh.ai is deployed, each Sonos device is automatically detected on the network and assigned to its proper room. Within a matter of seconds, Josh.ai also pulls compatible streaming services signed into the local Sonos account. As part of the Josh.ai Distributed AV workflow, Sonos Ports and Amps are then configurable as input sources that are routed across audio zones throughout the home.

### Sonos Integrations with Josh

- VoiceCast




VoiceCast projects Josh.ai’s verbal responses through Sonos speakers in the home instead of through Josh Micro’s internal speaker. This innovative feature is exclusive to the Sonos and Josh.ai integration.







To configure VoiceCast, simply go to the settings icon of the Josh Micro tile that corresponds to the room its Sonos player is located in. Then scroll down to the VoiceCast drop down menu and select the Sonos device that broadcasts to that room.







VoiceCast currently is supported with the following Sonos products:

[Sonos One](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/one.html) ,
[Sonos One SL](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/one-sl.html) ,
[Sonos Amp](https://www.sonos.com/en-nz/shop/amp.html) ,
[Sonos Play:5](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/play5.html) ,

More than Voice: Josh Micro is equipped with a capacitive LED touch ring along its outer edge, which functions as a contextual slider that can be used to manipulate lighting, shades, and music volume. When a user gives a command to turn on music like, “Ok Josh, listen to The Beatles,” the touch slider is temporarily enabled to control that room's audio. Tracing a finger around the slider will then adjust the music volume. After about 30 seconds of inactivity, the slider mode will return to its configurable default setting for that room.

- Grouping



Music lovers can enjoy their tunes however and wherever fits the mood by grouping audio zones through verbal commands or the Josh.ai app:

- "OK Josh, play Coldplay in the kitchen, living room, and patio."
- "OK Josh, listen to party music everywhere." (activates every audio zone in the home)

In the Josh.ai app, users can see what speakers are currently active and group desired audio zones together to seamlessly extend the experience throughout their home.

- Content



Compatibility with Sonos favorites allows Josh.ai to access playlists or stations on any streaming service.

The Story Behind the Logo

Josh is a home’s best friend. And like a dog, Josh is intelligent,
responsive, and learns his owner’s commands. While other smart home
control systems only know one trick, Josh combines all aspects of
smart homes into one friendly, well-trained responder. Josh is your
companion, and always happy to see you come home.

In a world where convenience and safety go hand in hand, Josh.ai is going beyond orchestrating elegant experiences across the smart home. Empowered with the Josh App, clients enjoy a complete access control experience without the cost or hassle of traditional monitoring services.

If you’ve been thinking about stepping up your property’s security with AI-powered innovation, then let’s explore how to build a self-monitored system that’s seamlessly connected and customizable.

## Access Control from Anywhere 🔐

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/151057f54a7fc4e32d55ba5d93f7917ad12fcc8d-1212x806.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Ever left the house wondering if you forgot to lock the front door or close the garage door?

With the Josh App, you can check the status of your entranceways and ensure your property is secure. Conveniently tap, text, or talk to Josh and quickly lock down your home from anywhere. For additional peace of mind, create custom alerts that notify you when gates, garage doors, and locks have been activated so you always know who is coming and going.

## Intelligent Security Solutions🚨

Thanks to custom push alerts, you’re notified of any security activity or vulnerability instantly and able to decide the best course of action.

In addition to arming, disarming, and setting alarm systems to arm-away mode, customers can view recent activity to see when specific security sensors have been activated around their home. Changes in the state of an alarm panel can also trigger a scene, or be activated by a scene such as “Vacation Mode,” that includes integrated lights, shades, music, and more devices to deter any unwanted visitors.

## Keep an Eye on What Matters Most 👀

Want to make sure the package you’ve been waiting for was delivered? Or see what your dog is up to?

The Josh App takes live surveillance to the next level with an AI-powered feature called Josh Vision. Homeowners can simply ask, “Hey Josh, what is happening at the front door?” Josh.ai will then analyze the camera feed and intelligently describe what it sees to make home monitoring easier and more interactive.

## An Interactive Gatekeeper at Your Door 🚪

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/07952688ac6032c5d43e1eafa61b38fafe93daa5-1210x804.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Whether you’re at home or on-the-go, Josh.ai makes it easy to greet anyone that comes to your door.

DoorLink is an AI-powered gateway for homeowners to see, communicate, and control property access from anywhere. Easily communicate with guests, verify identities, and grant property access with a simple voice command or the tap of a button. For example, Josh.ai can alert a homeowner if someone is at their front gate and, without getting out of their seat, they can simply tell Josh.ai to open their gate all using natural voice commands.

## Why Self-Monitor? 👉

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/c63268e744dd5b05203500d904b2e4f8c2a94f37-1200x800.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Self-monitored security is on your terms. No waiting for a third party to call the police and no worrying about false alarms. It’s a smarter and more integrated experience that:

- Alleviates concerns about privacy and data access
- Eliminates complex contracts and fees
- Offers complete control from your phone
- Provides instant notifications with live access
- Enables limitless customization with more smart home technology

With Josh.ai, clients are equipped with a modern home monitoring solution that features real-time push notifications when activity is detected, live camera analysis and generative surveillance insights, and two-way intercom with compatible door stations.

# Inside Josh.ai’s Winter Launch Event: Innovation Unveiled

March 18, 2025

The [Josh.ai Winter Launch Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRW98khnUQQ&feature=youtu.be) was not only about unveiling new products, features, and partnerships. It was also the culmination of months of hard work, creativity, and dedication from the entire [Josh.ai](https://www.josh.ai/) team. From scripting initial concepts to producing the final reveal, every department played a pivotal role in bringing the event to life.

Now that the dust has settled, we wanted to share an exclusive look at what went on behind the scenes to make our launch a success.

## Crafting the Vision

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ox9pxPxbmyGcnATnBuD6bA.png)

Long before the cameras started rolling, our design and development teams were hard at work refining how our technology would transform user experiences. From the [Josh App’s](https://www.josh.ai/app) reimagined music controller to upgrading [JoshGPT](https://www.josh.ai/joshgpt/) 3.0’s expanded intelligence, every detail was carefully considered to ensure we were delivering the most robust smart home experience yet.

Meanwhile, our marketing team was busy crafting the messaging and visuals that would make these innovations sing. As always, the goal being to capture the essence of luxury, intelligence, and seamless control that defines Josh.ai.

## Behind the Camera

To showcase our latest releases in the best light, we filmed across multiple stunning locations in order to highlight the elegance and power of Josh.ai in real-world environments. Our crew worked tirelessly to capture the perfect shots, ensuring every frame reflected the sophistication and ease that Josh.ai brings to smart living.

A special thank you to Chace Williams from [Dreamedia](https://dreamediaav.com/) for allowing us to shoot in his client’s luxury mountain home, which served as a breathtaking backdrop for our showcase. We also want to recognize AJ Brunson from [Cinegration](https://www.cinegration.com/), who was our very first dealer to get hands-on with the new [Josh One](https://www.josh.ai/one). Their contributions helped bring this launch to life in a big way!

# How to Introduce Clients to the Josh App: CEO Tips & Demonstration 👉📱

May 13, 2025

[Integrations](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Integrations) [Tutorials](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Tutorials) [Thought Leadership](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Thought+Leadership)

In the evolving landscape of residential technology, Josh.ai is proud to be at the forefront of modern living experiences. The award-winning Josh App stands out with full-featured device control, limitless customization, and the flexibility to text or talk to your home from anywhere. Join our CEO, Alex, on a walkthrough detailing how he lives with Josh.ai and his tips for demonstrating the Josh App to smart home clients.

With so many impressive AI-powered features, homeowners may not fully grasp the full potential of the Josh App without a proper demonstration. That’s where Josh.ai’s network of professional installers come in. By showcasing how Josh.ai can seamlessly access lighting, climate, shades, security, music, TV, and more devices, dealers can transform a standard tech walkthrough into a compelling, personalized experience.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/8fff567fe2f94a6afccf0fc0e081d3dd3cb07e82-1210x784.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

A hands-on demonstration allows customers to see, and hear, what sets Josh.ai apart. Instead of explaining features, professionals can guide homeowners through day-to-day scenarios applicable to their lifestyle. Easily adjust the temperature with an intuitive thermostat controller, set mood lighting and music for a dinner party, or create custom push notifications if activity is detected after bedtime. By demonstrating popular activations at a user’s fingertips, dealers build confidence in utilizing everything a Josh.ai smart home has to offer while highlighting the value of a professionally integrated system. In turn, reinforcing a client’s perception of the quality and care they’re investing in.

Ultimately, professional demonstrations bridge the gap between advanced technology and user accessibility. A well-received walkthrough helps demystify setup misconceptions, inspire deeper engagement, and foster trust in the product and installer. For smart home customers, this means a more satisfying, tailored experience. For integrators, it leads to happier clients, stronger referrals, and increased opportunities for product upgrades and service contracts.

In a Josh.ai smart home, seeing truly is believing!

# Introducing New Enhancements to the Josh + AVA Remote Experience🪄

May 6, 2025

[Product Announcements](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Product+Announcements) [Smart Home Technology](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Smart+Home+Technology) [Voice Control](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Voice+Control)

The Josh + AVA remote experience puts the power of AI in the palm of your hand with an adaptive remote interface, contextual voice control, and limitless customization. The companies continue to work closely, leveraging their software expertise to perfect an elegant and unique experience that is unmatched across the universal remote control landscape. In a Josh smart home, an AVA remote is a powerful, intuitive, and convenient touch device companion that empowers clients like never before.

We are proud to share that the following user experience updates have been pushed to all customers and are available today!

## User Experience Updates 👉

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/b713740633c344f4e9a7ba7db59227edb3a99e70-800x500.gif?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

1. Audio Ducking Support: Set music and TV volume to decrease when giving voice commands to Josh through your remote. 🔊
2. Music at Your Fingertips: Music has always been accessible and is now moving directly to the home screen. Toggle this setting on to manage all of your media directly from the TV controller. 🎶
3. Instant Room Switching: Quickly change the room your remote is controlling from the home screen of the remote itself. ⚡️
4. Rapid Wake Time: Responsiveness improvements result in your remote being quicker to wake and instantly ready to use the moment you pick it up. 💨
5. Double the Battery Life: Enjoy 2x longer standby battery life on Cinema Remotes thanks to various software optimizations. 🔋
6. Password Lock: Add a PIN code in the Josh Portal so users can’t change settings or accidentally logout. 🔒
7. Enhanced Dynamic Keypad Performance: Full support has been added for AVA’s latest Dynamic Keypad update, delivering smoother and more responsive experiences. 🚀
8. Control Any Device: Stay tuned for an update soon that will add the ability to control every device in the home from the remote! 🏠

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/40b4dbf49a8e676058c9008c8430ad27021c9516-800x500.gif?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

## Cinema Remote Stability Improvements 🤝

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/a2e8b4f41dd70f011793344a6bc9ba5023bf3a01-1212x808.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Josh and AVA have worked together to roll out key updates to enhance the Cinema Remote’s dynamic keypad. Recent collaboration has led to stability fixes that resolve a rare issue with screen orientation flipping. AVA also improved touch accuracy after discovering that occasional misclicks were due to the ergonomics of how some users gripped the remote. By expanding the touch target zones around the keypad’s three dimensional glass, the remote now responds more reliably no matter how it is held.

# Josh.ai Marks 10th Anniversary with Exclusive Limited‑Edition Hardware

April 15, 2025

[Innovation](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Innovation) [Newsroom](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Newsroom) [Product Announcements](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Product+Announcements)

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/ef8c98d6dfd0383322f5cdf5b302e1bd74466334-800x532.gif?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

DENVER, CO — April 15th, 2025 — Josh.ai, the custom installation channel’s modern control platform of choice, is celebrating a decade in business this month. Since its founding in 2015, Josh.ai has proudly disrupted the custom electronics industry with cutting edge product development and AI-powered innovation. The company’s tenth birthday serves as a moment to reflect on how Josh.ai has pushed the boundaries of technology in the home since its inception.

In honor of this milestone, Josh.ai has introduced a special version of its new Josh One processor in metallic gold. Available now, the metallic gold Josh One was produced in a small batch, and is offered in limited quantities as a promotion to current Josh.ai dealers.

“The last ten years have flown by thanks to the excitement and commitment of our partners. We are proud to have built a company focused on building dealers the solutions they need to enable simple, magical, and private smart home experiences in the era of AI,” says Josh.ai CEO Alex Capecelatro. “It has been a wild ride for our team with so many memorable moments and achievements, and I cannot wait to see where Josh.ai will be in another decade!”

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/ef870e5115aabdaf1c9fef6f274a10e0cb50c1c7-1216x680.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Josh.ai has built a brand with mass-market appeal while staying true to professionals, introducing innovative products available only to authorized dealers. In addition to establishing itself as the industry leader in voice control, Josh.ai has evolved into a leading whole-home automation platform for its network of over 2,000 certified dealers across North America.

After shipping the first Josh.ai product on a Mac Mini in 2016, the award-winning Josh Micro was launched in 2017 to bring voice control and AI based home automation to a broader audience within the pro channel. At the end of 2020, the company shook up the industry once again with its unveiling of Josh Nano and Josh Core during its first ever Keynote presentation.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/febff6931d1bd553d0895be7f014c90ee9a0057b-1214x804.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

In 2021, the company launched its collaboration with Lutron to introduce the Josh.ai Ready Wallplate, combining Lutron Keypads with Josh Nano architectural microphones. The Josh.ai Ready Wallplate delivers the ability to control a variety of home technology with voice, while maintaining tactile control for the most used scenes, accessible at the touch of a button through keypads. For example, clients can push a pre-programmed “Relax” button on their keypad and also access the nearly 16.7 million colors from Ketra, simply by asking for what they want.

In partnership with AVA, the company debuted its first universal remote control experience in 2022 to put the power of Josh.ai in the palm of every client’s hand. Josh.ai then transformed the breadth of its AI and control capabilities in 2023, with the introduction of JoshGPT’s limitless intelligent assistance and the debut of its first generation Josh One control processor respectively.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/09256bcc41e53ca9afc9a1b4f5ad2d3b6c82f440-1210x834.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

2024 was a banner year for Josh.ai, highlighted by the launch of the award-winning AI OS software product as the foundation powering the Josh App and all of its user interfaces. Josh Touchscreen started shipping, providing clients with the best of traditional control along with industry-leading innovation in every room. Josh Edge was presented to dealers as a simple hard-button remote and reached its crowdfunding goal to kick off development; Josh.ai plans on shipping Josh Edge later in 2025. Last but not least, was the debut of Nimble DevSuite as Josh.ai’s open source integration platform focused on propelling the future of interoperability in the smart home.

Following its 2025 Winter Launch Event, Josh.ai is positioned at the forefront of home intelligence going forward. Thanks to the redesigned Josh One control processor, compelling software features like DoorLink intercom and the Josh App’s reimagined music controller, and unmatched AI capabilities with JoshGPT 3.0, Josh.ai continues raising the bar in the modern home.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/123f10bbe91a34d95529b55aed7ad6612fbfad11-1212x806.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Josh.ai turning ten is a testament to the vision of its leadership and unwavering support of the CI community. The company’s continued growth would not be possible without a shared commitment to excellence among its dealers and integration partners. Driven by a passion for innovation, joyous user experiences, and the limitless potential of connected living spaces, the best is yet to come for AI in the home!

# Josh.ai’s Fort Collins Retreat: Team Bonding Through Biking, Brainstorms & Boating🚀

June 17, 2025

[Company News](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Company+News) [Thought Leadership](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Thought+Leadership) [Wellness Tech](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Wellness+Tech)

The Josh team just wrapped up an unforgettable company retreat in beautiful Fort Collins, Colorado. Against the backdrop of this inspiring setting, our time together was the perfect blend of strategy, adventure, and meaningful connection!

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/b3f6b3b49e6784b481deccde79acc9f1aec4afdf-1558x1196.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Over several energizing days, we dove deep into the future of Josh and modern living—exploring bold ideas, refining our vision, and aligning on priorities that will shape the next phase of our journey. These strategy sessions weren’t just about plans and roadmaps—they sparked the kind of conversations that remind us why we do what we do.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/5ddb44947149a48e1e03bb830c442a8ccb607a7a-1574x1094.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Of course, it wasn’t all work! We challenged ourselves with an ambitious bike ride through Fort Collins’ scenic trails and recharged out on the water at Horsetooth Reservoir. These moments outside the meeting room gave us space to bond, reflect, and celebrate the incredible team spirit that defines Josh.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/d8d7013c1bc9bbb54976d20d1fa2ad0b010fc593-1614x1300.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Every interaction during this retreat reinforced what makes this group so special. Our team isn't just building AI for the home, we’re shaping the future of how technology can transform living experiences.

# Josh.ai Introduces Vinny: The AI That Manages Your Smart Home & Your Money 💰

April 1, 2025

[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Artificial+Intelligence) [Innovation](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Innovation) [Tutorials](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Tutorials) [Thought Leadership](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Thought+Leadership)

In a groundbreaking leap forward, Josh.ai is increasing its AI capabilities with Vinny — The world’s first intelligent assistant that automates your financial future.

DENVER, CO — April 1st, 2025 — For years, [Josh.ai](http://josh.ai/) has been pushing the boundaries of AI in the connected home. From orchestrating natural control of every customer’s favorite devices to tapping into trillions of data points with the introduction of [JoshGPT](https://www.josh.ai/joshgpt/). On the heels of the company’s [2025 Winter Launch Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRW98khnUQQ&feature=youtu.be) where they released JoshGPT 3.0, which is empowering clients with a personal sports center, conversational DJ, and mood lighting expert for effortless living experiences, Josh.ai is rolling out its most valuable AI feature yet.

Today, Josh.ai is enriching its luxury clientele’s lives even more with Vinny. A first of its kind AI investment assistant that makes owning a Josh.ai smart home not only worth it, but an invaluable user experience. To date, other assistants have only been able to answer questions about stocks and investments. Vinny takes proactive action by anticipating growth opportunities, integrating across supported bank accounts, and adapting its financial strategies based on each user’s preferences.

Vinny acts as your personal quantitative analyst projecting emerging market trends, future economic conditions, and compiling stock picks that are definite winners. Seasoned investors will enjoy adjusting Vinny’s risk and reward settings to dip into the worlds of futures trading, crypto currency, and sports gambling. Josh.ai has also collaborated with industry-leading partners to launch Vinny, including Robinhood, Coinbase, FanDuel, Polymarket, and Vinny’s cousin Sal from Atlantic City.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bB841rpYbRGB0Hvj2sqopQ.png)

“Vinny is programmed with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and intuitive understanding of institutional investing,” said Alex Capecelatro, CEO of Josh.ai. “It operates using the simple, yet effective double-or-nothing principles to ensure our customers are positioned to increase their financial fortunes. Our goal with Josh.ai is to power joyous experiences and thanks to Vinny, we are now able to offer the exhilarating rush of sure-fire profitability!”

## Vinny’s Features Include:

- **Stock Trading:** Curious about investing in hot stocks? _“Hey Josh, should I invest in Nvidia?”_ will result in Vinny taking swift action, liquidating current stock holdings to sell penny stock options as a more lucrative approach.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m7YVM_MlIpwCG70Mci2-5A.png)

- **Crypto Investing:** Interested in the burgeoning world of digital assets? Asking _“Hey Josh, what’s the five year outlook for Bitcoin?”_ will prompt Vinny to buy $50K of whichever meme coin is poised to pump to the moon!
- **Sports Betting:** Have a good feeling about who will win the big game? _“Hey Josh, what are the odds for the Super Bowl?”_ will lead Vinny to take the initiative to put $100K on the Chiefs and don’t worry, Vinny also teased the over and parlayed it all with a prop bet on the number of Taylor Swift appearances during the TV broadcast.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-v0IYrWbajhMvZWDYwxyLA.png)

- **Gambling History:** Unsure of Vinny’s (your) recent activity? _“Hey Josh, I don’t remember placing this bet” results in_ Vinny assuring you that you did, in fact, say _“put it all on red”_ while slightly intoxicated at 2 am.
- **Loan Procurement:** Need extra cash to cover a few of Vinny’s prophetic investments and lifestyle enhancing purchases? Thanks to friendly loan programs without any paperwork requirements, Vinny’s cousin Sal will float Josh.ai users with a small compounding interest payment.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1EzGAzwcnplGvytRV_lxYA.png)

- **Tax Optimization:** Worried about the IRS asking questions? Vinny knows a guy who knows a guy who can launder your newfound wealth to make those questions go away.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A6gV8Pl28fVcrVvNW2nylQ.png)

## Beta Users Rejoice

The reviews and returns are already rolling in. “Ever since I put my money into Vinny’s hands, I’ve been able to finance a new Ferrari, a beach house in the Caymans, and my bank account has never seemed bigger,” raved an anonymous beta tester, known among friends as ‘FTX Whale.’ “My wife may have left me, but she didn’t understand that Vinny’s cousin Sal is mostly harmless… as long as I pay him back by Friday.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XC7JCCrWCx6hH5zLS4UVBw.png)

Starting April 1st, Vinny will be pushed via an over-the-air update to all Josh.ai systems. Every client will have the power to secure their financial futures with a personalized wealth manager. **Let it ride with Vinny today!**

**What do you do at Josh?**
As a Project Coordinator for Business Development and Marketing, I support Josh.ai's strategic growth initiatives by coordinating marketing campaigns, client outreach, and sales enablement efforts. I collaborate across teams to streamline project execution, manage timelines, and ensure alignment with brand objectives and business development goals.

Chatham, IL

I love having music available on demand and to control and listen to it anywhere in the house!

**What are you most excited about over the next few years?**
I'm excited to see how AI and home automation can continue to merge to simplify and enhance daily routines. Whether it's automating tasks, improving home energy efficiency, or simply making life more enjoyable, I’m looking forward to seeing how we redefine luxury living through technology.

**iPhone or Android?**
iPhone

**What do you do for fun?**

**If you could go anywhere, where would it be?**
I was lucky enough to visit my top bucket list destination, Japan, in 2024. Next up is Italy — I’d love to explore my roots, try all the regional cuisines, and soak in the history and culture.

**Favorite restaurant in the world?**
As a self-proclaimed foodie, that’s a tough one! But if I had to choose, my top three would be The Addison in San Diego, The French Laundry near Napa, and Oriole in Chicago. Each one was an unforgettable experience!

Scenes are my favorite feature. I love the ability to instantly shift the entire atmosphere of a room with a single command. The instant transformation of a space is really cool!

# Josh.ai Proudly Partners with Unified Representatives

June 24, 2025

[Company News](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Company+News) [Newsroom](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Newsroom) [Partnerships](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Partnerships)

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/d8b7b7563ad3643a053d9b3f3e691529a19df6a8-2116x1188.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

DENVER, CO - June 24, 2025 - Josh.ai continues expanding its industry presence and the availability of artificial intelligence in the home by partnering with Unified Representatives, a premier manufacturers’ rep firm, to support the rapidly growing dealer base in Southern California.

Unified Representatives is led by Doug Cuneo and Adam Owens of CET & Associates, along with Patrick Boyer of Innovative Marketing and Consulting. With a proven track record representing Josh.ai in other key regions, the leadership team has come together to form Unified, a powerhouse rep firm dedicated to providing expert guidance and white-glove support to dealers throughout Southern California. Their team of 11 account managers includes many professionals formerly with Lutron’s direct team in the region, offering deep industry experience and relationships.

“We’re thrilled to welcome Unified Representatives to the Josh family,” said Ryan Conway, Director of Sales at Josh.ai. “Southern California is a critical market for our brand, and Unified’s deep understanding of our technology and shared values around partnership and professionalism make them the ideal firm to lead our efforts in the region.”

Unified Representatives will be responsible for business development, dealer support, and training across the Southern California territory. Dealers can expect proactive communication, hands-on assistance, and seamless integration of Josh.ai into their smart home projects.

“We’re excited to hit the ground running,” said Doug Cuneo, Managing Partner at Unified Representatives. “This partnership is about more than territory coverage. It is about helping our dealers navigate the future of smart home technology. Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing the way people live in and interact with their homes. Josh.ai leads that transformation by delivering control that is intuitive, natural, and personalized. We believe the dealers who embrace AI will become the next generation of market leaders. Our goal is to equip them with the tools, knowledge, and support they need to succeed.”

Launched in 2015 as an advanced AI for the custom home, Josh.ai has since grown into a complete control solution. Through years of development refining robust integrations, innovative features, and purposeful design, the Josh.ai platform has set a new standard for modern living experiences. Luxury clients expect AI as part of today’s technology solutions and Josh.ai is the only platform that allows them to use AI in the context of home control across touch, text, and voice commands.

Once installed on the local network, Josh.ai is among the most efficient control experiences to deploy. A differentiating feature with all of Josh.ai’s integrations include auto-discovery of partner products, enabling rapid configuration and seamless control. Once it is deployed in a new environment, Josh.ai instantly connects to the local network and begins detecting compatible devices for a dramatically reduced setup time when compared to other control platforms. Within seconds, users can freely interact with their surroundings through the Josh App.

After deploying a Josh.ai system, installers can easily access remote support tools in the web-based Josh Portal. Josh.ai also diligently updates its integrations to ensure compatibility with new models and features to proactively support its connected device ecosystem.

# Josh.ai Voted an Industry Leader in 2025 CEPro Brand Rankings🚀

May 28, 2025

[Industry Events](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Industry+Events) [Newsroom](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Newsroom) [Smart Home Technology](https://www.josh.ai/stories?topic=Smart+Home+Technology)

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/a8aa5ceb37e42673cdfe7fa36796d0e53bbf4e9e-1218x682.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Every year, [CE Pro releases its highly anticipated Brand Analysis rankings.](https://www.cepro.com/news/ce-pro-100-brand-analysis-2025-what-products-are-rated-best-by-the-pros/618686/?utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--8DmTlo_qDa4VTTo2uLXcMT_OoERAIm67UnHAItQah-EZuQAJMr-x6EQ9d8QQgCwKdmzvEbUv934svo2sNEcua1sFWBA&_hsmi=362963341&utm_content=362963341&utm_source=hs_email) This comprehensive report is based on the input of the top 100 revenue-generating custom installation companies across the country. Each dealership is asked to rank their preferred manufacturers in various device categories, reflecting impactful trends and the trusted vendors embraced by some of the most successful companies in the industry.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/7fb1ca6d772c21d17b7f7ccb228c9f88afc02876-1098x824.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

One category that has garnered significant interest since its creation has been voice control, which historically favored mass market solutions like Amazon, Apple, and Google. Over the years, Josh.ai made steady progress and in 2024, took over the top spot from Amazon as the industry’s leader in voice control. In 2025, Josh.ai has continued gaining market share and solidified its position as the favorite for half of the industry’s leading integrators.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/c60224d3cc738fdd937543c0b58f715b5727dd11-1156x954.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/355f27f2c01546e06fb5be257a5b2b8e21ae43d3-1168x954.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

While Josh.ai launched in 2015 as an advanced AI for the custom home, it has since grown into a complete control solution — Surging into the industry’s top 5 automation platforms for the first time in 2025. Through years of development refining robust integrations, innovative features, and purposeful design, the Josh.ai platform has uniquely laid the groundwork for smart homes going forward. With many dealers shifting their businesses to utilize Josh.ai as their primary control system, it will be exciting to see what the Whole-House Automation/Integration rankings look like in 2026!

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/exzalvt1/production/5bb676af2b33eaf4c08c74530c5e4c709a5c2ce2-1212x680.png?q=75&w=1200&auto=format)

Josh.ai’s continued growth is not only a testament to its innovative technology, but also to the unwavering support and feedback from every dealer that has believed in its vision. The dedication of our partners has been instrumental in Josh.ai becoming an industry leader in the era of AI-powered control experiences.

As the Josh.ai team celebrates both achievements, we are more committed than ever to continue building cutting-edge solutions that transform how we interact in our living spaces. The journey continues with Josh.ai poised to continue moving up the Whole-House Automation/Integration rankings in the years to come. With Josh Edge on the horizon, Josh.ai is also eager to make its mark in the Universal Remotes/Tablets category.

The Service may allow you to register an account, for instance by
successfully completing a Josh purchase, by creating an account
through our website, or when invited to a property by another User.
Your Company account gives you access to the Service and
functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time
and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of
accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Company account
on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity under your
account, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you
represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of
the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement,
and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By
connecting to Company with a third-party service, you give us
permission to access and use your information from that service as
permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for
that service.


You may never use another User’s account without permission. When
creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete
information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs
during use of the Services through your account, including all guest
and other user accounts under your Company account, and you must
keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong”
passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case
letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify
Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of
your account. Company will not be liable for any losses caused by
any unauthorized use of your account.


You may control your User profile and how you interact with the
Service by changing the settings in your account settings page. By
providing Company your email address and physical address you
consent to our using the email address and physical address to send
you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law,
in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email
address and physical address to send you other messages, such as
changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not
want to receive such messages, you may opt out or change your
preferences in your account settings page. Opting out may prevent
you from receiving physical mail and email messages regarding
updates, improvements, or offers.

etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request
messages to the Company servers than a human can reasonably produce
in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web
browser (except that Company grants the operators of public search
engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from
www.josh.ai for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent
necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the

prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce
limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.


Accessing the audiovisual content available on the Service for any
purpose or in any manner other than Streaming (as defined below) is
expressly prohibited. “Streaming” means a contemporaneous digital

Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or
create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or
temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without
notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole
determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no
reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue
to be bound by this Agreement.

and for any acts or omissions of any third parties who use the
Service through your Company account. We reserve the right, but have

Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.


User Content

Some areas of the Service allow Users to provide or record content
such as profile information, comments, questions, commands, and
other content or information. Any and all content or materials
(including without limitation personal data or information) a User
submits, provides, records or otherwise makes available on or
through any functionality of the Service and any information
recorded by a User’s actions on the Service, but excluding any data
derived by Company from the foregoing (which is owned by Company and
may be used by Company for any purpose subject to the terms of this
Agreement and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.josh.ai/privacy-policy)) is

to other Users and other services and products you use with the
Service, you agree to allow such other individuals, and other
services and products you use with the Service, to view, edit,
and/or share your User Content in accordance with your settings and
this Agreement. Other individuals whom you permit to use the Service
through your account, and other services and products you use
through the Service may have access to data regarding your use of
the Service, as well as your profile information, including your
name, photo, and other personal information. Company has the right
(but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User

objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is
illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider

secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not
have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or
fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or
content that you know is not correct and current; or (ix) violates
any school or other applicable policy, including those related to
cheating or ethics. You agree that any User Content that you post
does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind,
including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as
defined below) or rights of privacy. To the extent that your User
Content contains music, you hereby represent that you are the owner
of all the copyright rights, including without limitation the
performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect
to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound
recording contained in such User Content and have the power to grant
the license granted below. Company reserves the right, but is not
obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Company
believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. You
understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a
substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the
Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.


For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights”
means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral
rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark
rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual
property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence,
and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and
extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory
or other jurisdiction.


In connection with User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant
the following:


You have written consent of each and every identifiable natural
person who uses the Service through your account and who is included
in your User Content, including with respect to the use such
person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service
and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any
liability that may arise in relation to such use.


Your User Content and Company’s use thereof as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any
rights of any third party, including but not limited to any
Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.


Company may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under
this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees,
residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective
bargaining agreement or otherwise.


To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other
information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.


Company takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any
User Content. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content
and the consequences of recording, sending, posting or publishing
it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for
your distribution and publication of your User Content. You
understand and agree that you and other Users may be exposed to User
Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for
children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that
Company shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a
result of User Content.


IN ADDITION, COMPANY TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO
LIABILITY FOR ANY RESPONSES OR OUTPUT GENERATED BY THE SERVICE IN
RESPONSE TO QUERIES YOU MAKE TO THE SERVICE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
AGREE THAT SUCH RESPONSES AND OUTPUT MAY BE INACCURATE,
OBJECTIONABLE, INAPPROPRIATE OR OTHERWISE UNSUITED TO YOUR PURPOSE,
AND YOU AGREE THAT COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR
LOSS RESULTING FROM SUCH RESPONSES.

each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User

agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to
all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in
the Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party
license agreement, if any, authorizing use of such code. The
foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Software or any copy
thereof, and Company or its third party partners or suppliers retain
all right, title, and interest in the Software (and any copy

Software Plans

**Josh.ai Software Plan.** Certain aspects of the
Service may be provided for a fee or other charge. In particular,
Users may subscribe to a **“Software Plan”** in
connection with their purchase of a Josh device (such as Josh One™,
Josh Micro™ or Josh Core™). If you purchase a Software Plan
subscription, you are referred to here as a
**“Customer”** (and, for clarity, you remain a “User”
as defined above).


Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Software
Plan provides you and members of your household at one residential
address (unlimited user profiles) with full access to the Service’s
features on one respective Josh system. (For instance, one Software
Plan may be attached to one Josh One, Josh Micro, or Josh Core at
the same household), plus access to the Software, for as long as the
Software Plan remains active. Software Plan Customers will only have
access to the features and content available via the respective Josh
device attached to the Software Plan (e.g., VoiceLink and multiple
VLAN access are only available when using Josh Core).


**Software Plan Billing Cycles and Auto-Renewal.**
Software Plans have a monthly \[or yearly\] term, and renew
automatically on a monthly \[or yearly\] basis until canceled in
accordance with this Agreement. Billing occurs at the beginning of
the Software Plan cycle. By purchasing a Software Plan, you
acknowledge that your Software Plan has recurring payment features
and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations
prior to cancellation of your Software Plan by you or us. Your
failure to terminate and/or continued use of your Software Plan
reaffirms that we are authorized to charge you for that Software
Plan. To change or terminate your Software Plan, go to your Josh.ai
Account Settings in the Software, at
[portal.josh.ai](https://portal.josh.ai/), or contact Support at
[support@josh.ai](mailto:support@josh.ai).


**Software Plan Prepaid Periods.**
You may be given the opportunity to prepay for a period of one or
more months of your Software Plan. At the conclusion of a prepaid
period, unless you cancel prior to renewal, and to the extent
permitted by applicable law, your Software Plan will automatically
continue on a month-to-month basis at the then-existing
non-promotional price for your Software Plan.


**Other Software Plan Offers.** We may offer you
additional promotions or discounts related to Software Plans from
time to time. Please read the details of those offers carefully, as
any additional terms presented to you during the registration
process will form part of this Agreement. Unless we otherwise
specify in writing, all discount offers that require a payment are
non-refundable. Any free trial or other promotion must be used
within the specified time frame of the trial or promotion. You may
be required to have a valid payment method on file in order to
initiate a free trial; in this case, if you do not cancel before
your free trial period ends, your account will be converted to a
paid Software Plan and will be charged in accordance with this
Agreement.


**Your Termination of a Software Plan.** If you
terminate your Software Plan, you may use your Software Plan until
the end of the then-current period and your Software Plan will not
be renewed after that period expires. However, you will not be
eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Software Plan
fee paid for the then-current Software Plan period\[, subject to\
specific cancellation and refund rights listed below for certain\
Canadian residents\].


**Our Termination of a Software Plan.** We may
immediately terminate all or a portion of your Software Plan,
without notice if your payment is overdue (provided that we will use
reasonable efforts to notify you of the overdue payment before we
terminate or suspend), or for any other basis this Agreement permits
us to terminate your account, your access to the Service, or this
Agreement.


In the event that we determine, in our sole discretion, that your
Software Plan is being accessed in an unsupported setting or
location, we reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Software
Plan at any time by notifying you at the email address associated
with your Software Plan.


If we terminate or suspend your Software Plan, your license to use
any software or content provided in connection with the Software
Plan is also terminated or suspended (as applicable). If your
Software Plan is terminated, Company has the right to immediately
delete all data, files, and other information stored in or for your
account without further notice to you. You must pay all charges up
to and including the date of termination. Should you wish to resume
your Software Plan after any suspension, a restoration of service
fee may apply. This fee is in addition to all past due unpaid
charges and other fees.


Payments

**Billing Policies.** By your purchase or subscription,
you agree to our pricing and payment terms, as we may update them
from time to time; provided, however, that if the amount to be
charged varies from the amount you originally authorized (other than
due to applicable sales, VAT or similar taxes), we will provide
notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before
that scheduled date, unless applicable law requires you to expressly
consent to the change in price. You agree that we may accumulate
charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges
during or at the end of each billing cycle. Company may add new
services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges
for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion. Any
change to our pricing or payment terms shall become effective in the
billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in
this Agreement. We use Stripe as our third party payment processor,

account at any time; however, there are no refunds for cancellation,
except as may be expressly permitted under the Return Policy or

terminates your account or this Agreement, you understand and agree
that you shall receive no refund or exchange for any Company
Property, any unused time on a subscription, any license or
subscription fees for any portion of the Service, any content or
data associated with your account, or for anything else.


**Risk of Loss.** All products purchased from or via
the Service are transported and delivered to you by an independent
carrier not affiliated with, or controlled by, Company. Title to
products purchased on the Service, as well as the risk of loss for
such products, passes to you when Company or our supplier delivers
these items to the carrier.


**Payment Information.** All information that you
provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other
monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate,
complete, and current. You are responsible for keeping such
information up-to-date and must provide changes promptly to your
account page, which may be accessed in the Software or at
[portal.josh.ai](https://portal.josh.ai/). You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit
card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a
purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction
with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are
incurred. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to
use all payment method(s) that you provide to us (including to our
payment processor). You authorize the issuer of your selected
payment method to pay any amounts described herein without requiring
a signed receipt, and you agree that this Agreement shall be
accepted as authorization to the issuer of the payment method to pay
any amounts described herein, without requiring a signed receipt
from you. You authorize us to continue to attempt to charge and/or
place holds with respect to all sums described herein, or any
portion thereof, to your payment method until such amounts are paid
in full. You agree to provide updated payment information upon
request and any time the information you previously provided is no
longer valid. You acknowledge and agree that neither Company, nor
any Company representative, will have any liability whatsoever for
any insufficient funds or other charges incurred by you as a result
of attempts to charge, and/or place holds on, your specified payment
method as contemplated by this Agreement. If you provide a debit
card number instead of a credit card number, you authorize all
charges described herein to be applied to such debit card unless and
until you provide a credit card number. YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US
OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G.,
FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF
SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR
USERNAME OR PASSWORD. Any agreement you have with your payment
provider governs your use of your specified payment method.


**Taxes.** You will pay any applicable taxes, if any,
relating to any purchases, transactions or other monetary
transaction interactions made with us or through the Services.


**Billing Inquiries and Refunds.** If you believe you
have been billed in error, please notify us within 60 days of the
billing date by contacting Josh.ai Support at support@josh.ai.
Company will not issue refunds or credits after the expiration of
this 60-day period, except where required by applicable law.


**Payments to You.** Unless otherwise agreed by the
parties in writing, Company shall remit payments due to you
hereunder no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each
calendar month in which the applicable fees are received. Payment
shall be in the form you select when you register for the Service,
or as subsequently updated as permitted by the Service. Payments
shall only be made in those months in which the amount due to you
totals at least $10. Unpaid amounts due shall accrue until the next
month in which the amount due is at least $10. Company reserves the
right to withhold payment or charge back to your account any amounts
otherwise due to us under this Agreement, or amounts due to any
breach of this Agreement by you, pending Company’s reasonable
investigation of such breach. To ensure proper payment, you are
solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact
and payment information associated with your account, which includes
without limitation applicable tax information. If we believe that we
are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this
information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your
payments until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us
that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to
obtain tax information. Any third-party fees related to returned or
cancelled payments due to a contact or payment information error or
omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. You agree to
pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity
in connection with your participation in the Service. If you dispute
any payment we have made (or that you allege we are obligated to
make) hereunder, you must notify Company in writing within thirty
(30) days of such payment. Failure to so notify Company shall result
in the waiver by you of any claim relating to such disputed payment.
Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by
Company. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be
accepted by Company or have any effect under this Agreement. We may

Hardware Limited Warranty

Company warrants to the original owner of a Josh device purchased
and installed via our Services or an authorized Company dealer (the
“Product”) that the Product will be free from manufacturing defects
in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for the
period of eighteen (18) months from the date of purchase (“Limited
Warranty”). This Limited Warranty is only valid and enforceable in
locations Products are sold. This Limited Warranty only applies to
hardware components (and not any software elements) of Products, and
this Limited Warranty does not apply to damage caused by normal wear
and tear, accidents, misuse or failure to follow product
documentation, neglect, disassembly, alterations, servicing other
than by Company authorized technicians, and external causes such as,
but not limited to, water damage, anomalies in the electrical
current supplied to the device, and extreme thermal or environmental
conditions. This Limited Warranty does not guarantee that use of the
Products will be uninterrupted or error free. Nothing in this
Limited Warranty will reduce or otherwise affect your statutory
rights in relation to the Products.


If a defect arises and you return the Product during the
eighteen-month Limited Warranty period, Company will, in its sole
discretion and to the extent permitted by law, either repair your
Product using new or refurbished parts, replace your Product with a
new or refurbished Product functionally at least equivalent to
yours, or accept the return of your Product in exchange for
providing you a refund of the purchase price you originally paid for
it. If Company repairs or replaces Products, the repaired or
replaced Products will continue to be warranted solely for the
remaining time of the original Limited Warranty period. All returned
parts for which you have received a replacement will become the
property of Company.


To make a claim under the Limited Warranty, please call our customer
service department at during normal business hours 9 am to 5 pm PT,
excluding New Year’s Eve and Day, Memorial Day, July 4, Thanksgiving
Day, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and be ready to provide your
name, contact information and the serial number on the Product, as
well as a purchase receipt.

Company authorized dealer or Company authorized representative
within sixty (60) days of discovery of the Product defect.


•     Upon receiving a written notice of a

Warranty set forth in this Agreement, Company will issue you a
Return Material Authorization (RMA) number.


•     Covered products are tracked by serial
number and must be shipped (prepaid by you) to Company’s repair
facility. Original or original-like packaging must be utilized to
prevent damage in transit. Upon receipt of the Product, Company
shall inspect and test it.


•     In the event that Company determines that
your issues can be addressed by shipping a replacement part or
Product to you, Company will ship the replacement to your site.
Based on availability, Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to ship the replacement unit.


•     Replacement units will be new or like-new
quality.


•     If you fail to return the defective
Product within twenty (20) days of a replacement Product being
shipped to you, you will be charged the then-current fee for such
defective Product.


•     If Product is returned to Company for a
refund within the Limited Warranty period, the Product must be
shipped to the Company facility where it will either be restocked or
inspected and tested to determine the validity of the refund claim.
If Company determines the product is defective, it will refund the
customer and retain ownership of the Product.


•     Company is not responsible for
installation of replacement Products.


•     Separate “no trouble found” charges may
apply for Product returned under the warranty for repair that is
determined to be in good working order. Such costs are limited to
shipping, handling, testing, and administrative expenses.


•     Company liability on any claim for damages
arising out of or in connection with the manufacture, sale,
installation, delivery, or use of the Product shall never exceed the
purchase price of the Product.


•     Company is not responsible for any data
lost as part of the warranty return process.


•     It is the authorized dealer’s
responsibility to ensure that no confidential, proprietary, or
personal information remains on the defective Product before
returning to Company.


Warranty Exclusions:

•     This Limited Warranty does not cover the
cost or damage of Product installation, removal, or reinstallation.


•     This Limited Warranty shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy to the original purchaser. In no event shall
Company be liable for incidental or consequential damage of any
kind.


•     This Limited Warranty is voided and will
not cover any Product that has had the serial number tampered with,
removed, or altered in any way.


•     Company reserves the right to reject any
Product that fails to meet any and all limitations of the Limited
Warranty.


•     Company does not extend or provide
warranty for any third party product re-sold by Company or a Company
authorized dealer. All warranty claims for such third party products
must be made with the equipment manufacturer.


•     Product returned and damaged due to
inadequate packaging will be considered void of the Limited
Warranty.


•     The Limited Warranty will be voided if and
when there is any Product misuse, which includes:


     o     Product or
cosmetic defect due to accidental damage, dislodgement from a wall
or surface, abuse, neglect, flood, fire, earthquake, or any act of
god.


     o     Modifications to

States. Company makes no representations that the Service is
appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who
access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their
own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all
applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including
but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use
the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the

individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United
States.


Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver


**Governing Law.** You agree that: (i) the Service
shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service
shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal
jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions
other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the
internal substantive laws of the State of California, without
respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge
that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to
the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
(9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts located in Los Angeles County, California
for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents,
or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth
in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief
required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Los Angeles
County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an
arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that
the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.


**Arbitration.** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT
REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE
MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM COMPANY. For any dispute
with Company, you agree to first contact us at legal@josh.ai and
attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely
event that Company has not been able to resolve a dispute it has
with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim,
dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or
other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in
connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or
alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding
arbitration by JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”), under the Optional Expedited
Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided
herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration
will be conducted in Los Angeles County, California, unless you and
Company agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial
purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing,
administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules,
and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of
arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for
expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the
Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay
a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and
successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered
by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your
reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and
other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of
competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but
this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the
informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Nothing in this "Arbitration" section shall be deemed
as preventing Company from seeking injunctive or other equitable
relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or
threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data
security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.


**Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** WITH RESPECT TO ALL
PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR
USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL
CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION,
COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION,
AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE
MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY
KIND.


General

**Assignment.** This Agreement, and any rights and
licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by
you, but may be assigned by Company without restriction. Any
attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null
and void.


**Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.**
Company may provide notifications, whether such notifications are
required by law or are for marketing or other business related
purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or
through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by
Company in our sole discretion. Company reserves the right to
determine the form and means of providing notifications to our
Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of
notification as described in this Agreement. Company is not
responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider
may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you
provide us. Company may, in its sole discretion, modify or update
this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page
periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we
will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page.
Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes
your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to
any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or
access (or continue to access) the Service.


**Entire Agreement/Severability.** This Agreement,
together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may
enter into with Company in connection with the Service, shall
constitute the entire agreement between you and Company concerning
the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by
a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision
shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that
in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury
Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be
unenforceable.


**No Waiver.** No waiver of any term of this Agreement
shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any
other term, and Company’s failure to assert any right or provision
under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
provision.


**California Residents.** If you are a California
resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code §1789.3, you may report
complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of
Consumer Sites of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by

Speaking to Josh

Josh is always ready to assist, but only listens after being
addressed with its wake word. While most homes prefer using the
"OK Josh” wake word, more options are available depending on
your preference:


MICRO WAKE WORDS

OK Josh (default)


Ok / Hey Josh

Hey Micro

OK Home

Nikola

NANO WAKE WORDS

Ok / Hey Josh (default)

Simply talk to Josh like someone is in the room with you. Josh
will take direction and attempt to determine what you want given
the context of the environment. Your enunciation, syntax, and
the specificity in your requests go a long way in helping Josh
do its job. Check out some commands below that you can start
with. Click on the different categories on the left to see the
different examples.

Touch Control

Beyond voice control, Josh offers the ability to use capacitive
touch to activate its microphones, run automations, or
contextually adjust devices that were just spoken to:


![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/icon-nano-small.svg)JOSH NANO

Single Tap (Contextual)

Josh Nano remembers the last voice command you gave and
will toggle the state of that device with a single
tap.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/micro.svg)JOSH MICRO

Single or Double Tap

By default, a single or double tap to the face of Josh
Micro will mute the microphones and display a reddish
orange animation to signal it is not actively listening.
With the Josh App, you can customize what each tap action
does, such as running a scene, instead.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/tips-video-tap-still.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9ajC431atA)

LED Slider (Contextual)

Dragging your finger around the LED dial will adjust the
volume of Josh Micro speaking back to you. After giving a
command to lights (brightness), shades (height), or music
(volume), you can use the dial to make adjustments to
those devices for 30 seconds, thanks to Josh's memory. Set
the default behavior of Josh Micro's LED Slider in the
Josh App.

What the LEDs Mean

The LED ring is Josh's non-verbal way of communicating. Here’s
what the most common colors mean:


![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/nano/01-listening.gif)

Spinning Rainbow

Josh is awake and listening for your command. Josh never
listens more than five seconds.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/nano/02-processing.gif)

Pulsing Rainbow

Josh is processing the command you gave. Give it a moment
to respond to your request.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/nano/04-speaking.gif)

White Fluctuations

Josh is speaking. If you can’t hear anything, your device
volume may be turned all the way down.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/nano/03-muted.gif)

Spinning Red-Orange

Josh is muted and won't listen when you say the wake
word. Unmute your microphone by tapping the dog head logo
or in the Josh App.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/nano/05-no-internet.gif)

Spinning Blue

Josh is waiting to be connected to the internet. Your
Josh-certified home technology professional can help you
get the device online.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/nano/06-solid-white.png)

Solid White

Josh is restarting, please give the device a few minutes
to complete the reboot. Note: If the LEDs appear to have a
pink tone, then the device is not getting enough
power.

![](https://joshai.s3.amazonaws.com/new3/tips/nano/00-no-LEDs.png)

No Color

Josh is patiently waiting to be woken. Use the wake word
to activate the device and give instructions.

We're excited to welcome you into the Josh family. If you have any
questions, don't hesitate to consult your Home Technology
Professional. You can always reach out to us, too.

The Story Behind the Logo

Josh is a home’s best friend. And like a dog, Josh is intelligent,
responsive, and learns his owner’s commands. While other smart home
control systems only know one trick, Josh combines all aspects of
smart homes into one friendly, well-trained responder. Josh is your
companion, and always happy to see you come home.
